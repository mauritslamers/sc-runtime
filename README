SC-RUNTIME

A simple way of requiring SC for node projects.
This project is based off Sproutcore 1.4.5, with some additions.

WARNING: 
While as much as possible has been contained in modules, 
SC-RUNTIME will add extra methods to a few basic prototypes.
Without it, it cannot do the sugar it does.

To the Array prototype it adds many extra methods, 
from array parsers to observer related methods. 
(see lib/runtime/array.js, lib/runtime/copyable.js and lib/runtime/enumerable.js)

To the Function Prototype the methods 
#property, #cacheable, #idempotent and #observes are added

To the String prototype the methods #fmt, #loc and #w are added.

To the Date object the method #now is added.


How to use:

if installed as global NPM module:

var SC = require('sc-runtime'); 

if installed as clone: 

var SC = require('./sc-runtime');
